# NESTrisStatsViz
Simple Visualization for statistics


# Installation

1) Download the latest compiled .exe from [Releases](https://github.com/alex-ong/NESTrisStatsViz/releases)

2) Edit the config file (NESTrisStatsViz_Data\StreamingAssets\config.ini) to point to the right places
 - `python`: This is the executable; it should point to wherever you installed it
 - `workingdir`:  the directory where screecap.py resides
 - `pythonscript`: point this to screencap.py
 - `basedir`: This is where your game statistics will be saved. It saves in a .csv format, openable by excel
 
3) Run the exe. It should automatically start the OCR python program.

4) Use P to pause the visualization page, and spacebar to proceed. F1 to change to "native" resolution. You can hold the `left-shift` button as it boots up to change resolution.
